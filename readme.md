# How `rizzdown` Works

When I created `rizzdown`, I wrote this:

> I have a CLI tool which enhances markdown files using ChatGPT by taking into account author, audience, subject matter, type of prose, and body content. It then produces a `description` and `title` for frontmatter and an `# Overview`. it can also rewrite the entire content if requested. everything is fully controlled by the command line, and it even has exponential backoff in case of GPT API throttling. You install it using `npm i -g <tool>` or `npx <tool>`

...and `rizzdown` turned it into...

> <h3>Wait, no. Y-yo-you're reading it right now?!</h3>

That's right, I used `rizzdown` to write this `readme.md`! Look at that, you're the belle of the ball. Perfect for all you authors crafting SSG sites and wanting your Markdown to be not just readable, but _rizzmarkable_.

# ü§ñ API

## Introduction

`rizzdown` offers a programmatic way to enhance your writing, leveraging the power of OpenAI. Create custom profiles to tailor the enhancement to your unique voice, style, and audience.

## Getting Started

`rizzdown` runs on nodejs>16 only. It will not run in the browser.

```bash
npm i rizzdown
```

```ts
import { factory } from 'rizzdown'

const { generate } = factory({ profilePath, subjectMatter })

const rizzed = await generate(`Give me a funny 350 word summary`)
```

The `factory` function sets up the environment for generating enhanced content. `factory` supports these parameters. Everything is optional:

- `profilePath`: Defaults to `$RIZZDOWN_HOME/default`, which is probably `~/.rizzdown/default` unless you changed the `RIZZDOWN_HOME` environment variable. You can provide a custom path too, which is handy when you have profiles stored in your project repo.
- `promptIfProfileMissing`: Default `false`. If set to `true`, the system will prompt you for profile information if any is missing.
- `maxConcurrent`: Maximum number of concurrent OpenAI API calls.
- `subjectMatter`: The main content you wish to enhance.

If you don't provide `subjectMatter` in to `factory`, you'll need to provide it when you call `generate`:

```ts
const rizzed = await generate(`Give me a funny 350 word summary`, {
  subjectMatter: `...custom subjectMatter...`,
})
```

## More on Configuration and Profile Setup

### `RIZZDOWN_HOME`

- By default, `rizzdown` uses `~/.rizzdown` as the home directory for profiles. Customize this by modifying `RIZZDOWN_HOME` in `.profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`.

### OpenAI Secret Key

- Store the OpenAI secret key within the profile directory as `openai-secret-key`.
- Alternatively, use the `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. Any key passed in the environment will override any other secret key source.
- You can also store `openapi-secret-key` in `$RIZZDOWN_HOME`. Any profile that doesn't have its own secret key defined will use this global key.

### Profile Contents

A profile contains the following files:

- **`openai-secret-key`**: Optional secret key to use with this profile only.
- **`author.md`**: Author bio showcasing personality, background, and interests.
- **`subject.md`**: Background information about the writing's subject.
- **`audience.md`**: Description of the intended readership.
- **`style.md`**: Description of the desired writing style, tone, and platform.

## Advanced Features

### Context Enum

The `Context` enum helps identify different parts of a profile:

```ts
export enum Context {
  Style = 'style',
  Author = 'author',
  Subject = 'subject',
  Audience = 'audience',
}
```

### Throttling

The system leverages the `Bottleneck` library to handle rate limits, ensuring the OpenAI API isn't overwhelmed.

### Exponential Backoff

`rizzdown` gracefully handles retries with the `exponential-backoff` library, particularly useful if the OpenAI API requests get throttled.

# üõ† Crafting `rizzdown` Profiles By Hand

Dive deeper into customization! Craft a `rizzdown` profile by hand and tailor the enhancement to your distinct voice, style, and audience. Here's how to get started:

## Setting Up Your Home Base:

- By default, `RIZZDOWN_HOME` is nestled snugly at `~/.rizzdown`.
- Crave a change? Add `RIZZDOWN_HOME` to `.profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`. Adjust the path to wherever you'd like your `rizzdown` settings to reside.
- Flexing those programmatic muscles? Point to any desired spot during programmatic access.

## The OpenAI Key:

- Create a `openai-secret-key` file within `~/.rizzdown`. It should house your precious OpenAI secret key.
- Feeling rebellious? Sidestep the file approach and use the `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. `rizzdown` will smartly fetch the key from there.
- Bonus: Fancy using different keys? Store them safely inside individual profiles.

## Crafting Your Profile:

Profiles can have any name your heart desires and reside in `$RIZZDOWN_HOME/<profile-name>`. Here's what you need inside:

1. **`author.md`**:

   - Your spotlight! üåü
   - Pen down a bio capturing your essence: personality, interests, capabilities, and maybe that one time you fought a dragon (or just debugged a legacy codebase).

2. **`subject.md`**:

   - Your domain expertise.
   - Fill it with information you'd assume is common knowledge for your readers. It sets the stage for your prose's context.

3. **`audience.md`**:

   - Meet your reader! üìö
   - Describe their quirks, values, and their connection to your subject. The better you know them, the better `rizzdown` can tailor the content!

4. **`style.md`**:
   - Your desired narrative vibe.
   - Clarify your prose type: Blog post? Technical document? Mysterious tale of the haunted mainframe?
   - Define the tone: Humorous or serious? Casual chat or formal seminar? Describe any quirks to make the voice uniquely yours.

**Pro Tip**: Remember, the better and more detailed your profile, the closer `rizzdown` can get to mirroring your unique voice and intention!
